Let me help you evaluate whether SQLite is suitable for a small spare parts shop by analyzing its pros and cons in this context.
Yes, SQLite can be suitable for a small spare parts shop, and here's why:
Advantages for Small Spare Parts Shop:
Simplicity
No separate database server needed
Zero configuration required
Self-contained in a single file (spms.db)
Easy to backup (just copy the file)
Performance
Excellent for the typical workload of a small shop
Can handle:
Several thousand parts in inventory
Multiple concurrent sales transactions
Daily operations like stock updates and purchases
Fast read operations for price checks and inventory lookups
Resource Requirements
Very light on system resources
Works well on basic hardware
No need for dedicated server hardware
Reliability
ACID compliant (ensures data integrity)
Stable and well-tested
Built-in data corruption prevention
Limitations to Consider:
Concurrent Users
SQLite works best with up to 10-20 concurrent users
If your shop has more than 5-10 simultaneous users actively making database changes, you might experience occasional locks
Data Volume
Comfortable handling databases up to several GB
For a small spare parts shop, this typically means:
Tens of thousands of parts
Years of transaction history
Thousands of customers
Recommended Usage Scenarios:
SQLite is ideal if your shop has:
1-5 point-of-sale terminals
Up to 10 staff members
Inventory of up to 50,000 parts
Daily transactions in the hundreds
Single physical location
When to Consider Upgrading:
You should consider moving to a more robust database system (like PostgreSQL) if:
Your business grows to multiple locations
You need more than 10 concurrent users making writes
Your database size exceeds 5GB
You experience frequent "database is locked" errors
You need advanced features like full-text search or complex reporting
Best Practices for Using SQLite in Your Shop:
Regular Backups
Maintenance
Perform regular database vacuuming to reclaim space
Keep the system updated
Monitor the database file size
Performance Optimization
The system already implements proper indexing on:
Part numbers
Stock levels
Transaction dates
Customer information
Data Security
Keep the database file in a secure location
Implement proper file system permissions
Use the built-in user authentication system
Given these factors, SQLite is a perfectly viable choice for a small spare parts shop, especially when starting out. The current implementation includes all necessary features for:
Inventory management
Sales tracking
Purchase orders
Customer management
Financial reporting
Stock level monitoring
User access control
